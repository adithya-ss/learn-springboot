Springboot:

- Framework to build enterprise applications in Java.
- Platform to build both backend and web applications

Generate a bootstrapped springboot project structure: https://start.spring.io/

Resources:
	a. static: All the web resources live for web applications
	b. templates: All the templates for web applications
	c. application.properties: Properties for the application being built. Properties for different envs can be defined (dev, test, prod etc).

Each package of this project represents a perticular layer (API, Service and Data Access)

Model = Entity (End User - personName and personId)
Model - Getters and setters - Implementation of data encapsulation.

DAO - Interface (Operations allowed for anything which intends to implement this interface)

Service - Something which performs an operation.

API - Controllers

Dependency Injection: 
a. Technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies.
b. Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a service. The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. 
c. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The 'injection' refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.

When a DAO is not instantiated, annotations would be used to instantiate beans.
This is done so that a class can be instatiated as a bean for it to be injectable in other classes, by specifying @Repository.

@Service - For services
@Autowired - Injector/Injection.
Since interface implementations can be many, there should be a way to distinguish each implementation. This is acheived by using @Qualifier

@RestController - Expose end points. 
@PostMapping - Adding a resource to the server.

@JsonProperty - Convert a json property into java class. 
@RequestBody - Receive JSON payload from the actual body, inside the API. Convert the JSON object into our custom Object.
@RequestMapping - Create an end point. Path is specified here.
@GetMapping - Method to be served as a GET request.

For validation to avoid empty/blank data, the following dependency has to be added in pom.xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>

Once the above dependency is added, right click on Maven -> Reload Project. This will install the missing dependencies. (For IntelliJ)

@NotBlank - Data/String is not blank. Different from Null. String might not be null, but might just have blank characters.
@Valid - Data/String is valid. 
@NotNull - Data/String is not null.
